This is the material for the TDD for investment banking course written by Giovanni Asproni.

Inside the "slides" directory you'll find all the material used to produce the presentation:

* The slides in Mac OS X Keynote 5.3 format
* The pdf of the slides (for your convenience)
* Some graphics produced used Omnigraffle (6.0.x)
* The license covering the material

Inside the "example" directory you'll find all the source code for the examples, the jars of the external tools used, the Intellij Idea project files, and the licensing terms for the software. You can open the "example" directory directly from Idea, and you will have to configure only the JDK to use (I tested it with Java 7).

If you like the material and would like to organise a private course for your company, feel free to [contact me](http://www.asprotunity.com/contact.html) without obligation for more information . I also run this as a public course, and [here](http://www.asprotunity.com) you will find the dates for the upcoming ones.
